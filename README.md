lutris is literally the most broken website i swear

# osu! Lutris
A script that I made and tried to publish to Lutris, but Lutris is the most broken website to exist.

It (tries) to install osu! in Lutris, but due to how the osu! installer closes, it fails.

`osu-windows-fix.yaml` is an attempt to (somewhat) solve that issue, but it requires some manual intervention.
You must install osu! after Lutris claims the install is complete.

lutris-fshack wine builds seem to be broken when used on osu!

I recommend you use pipewire to eliminate audio latency (and to just get rid of pulseaudio ew)

## Manual installation

So, you don't want to use Lutris? Well too bad, I'm not writing this portion of the README right now. Check back some other time.
